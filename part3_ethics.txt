Bias Risk:
- Amazon reviews could reflect biased language (e.g., gendered expressions).
- MNIST is grayscale and simple; bias is low, but representation of digits can vary by culture.

Mitigation:
- Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators to evaluate group-wise fairness.
- Rule-based systems in spaCy can filter toxic or biased outputs.
